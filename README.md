# Exploring React Hooks (with Next.js)

Welcome to **Exploring React Hooks (with Next.js)**! This project provides a codebase dedicated to deepening our understanding of React hooks within the context of Next.js applications.

## About

React hooks have transformed how we manage state and side effects in functional components. In this project, tailored for Next.js, we'll delve into the various built-in hooks, explore their applications within the Next.js framework, and experiment with real-world scenarios where hooks can elevate our Next.js projects.

## How It Works

Each React hook will have its own dedicated file within this project. We'll demonstrate the usage of hooks, discuss Next.js-specific use cases, and provide practical examples to solidify our grasp of their integration within a Next.js environment.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey of Exploring React Hooks with Next.js, clone the repository and delve into the provided hook example files. You can run them in your preferred Next.js development environment to witness hooks harmonizing with Next.js.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dixitaditya/exploring-react-hooks.git
cd exploring-react-hooks
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Feel free to immerse yourself in the examples, experiment, and contribute!

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
